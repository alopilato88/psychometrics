## Overview

Measurement proves crucial to both understanding the nature and structure of the phenomena we wish to study, as well as understanding antecedents and consequent effects. In some areas, measurement seems more straightforward than others, such as the assignment of meters to describe the length of an object. In other instances, measurement is more difficult because the thing we wish to measure is not directly observable, as is the case of measurement of heat through its influence on mercury in a thermometer. In psychological science measurement is almost always indirect, and therefore necessitates a set of principles that define the link between the psychological property of interest and the numbers we use to describe them. Psychometrics is the sub-field of psychology that is concerned with deriving the principles that link latent (or unobservable) variables with the numbers used to describe them. This course surveys this sub-field that begins by grounding psychometrics in the psychophysical tradition from which it came – namely, psychophysics – building up to relatively recent advances in the field, including latent variable theories.
