## Overview

Measurement is foundational to any scientific field. In order to apply statistical models and methods to test our theories, we must first be able to accurately measure the concepts posited by our theory. Measurement can be more difficult in the social and behavioral sciences compared to the physical sciences. Unlike the physical sciences, in the social and behavioral sciences most measures are constructed to measure concepts that have no physical representation like attitudes and perceptions. That is, in the social and behavioral sciences measurement is almost always indirect and requires measurement theories that allow us to connect our observable measures (e.g. item responses) to their underlying concepts (or constructs). Psychometrics---more commonly referred to as Quantitative Psychology---is a sub-field of psychology that focuses on developing measurement theories and statistical models that allow us to more accurately measure, describe, and draw inferences about psychological phenomena. This course is designed to introduce students to the measurement theories and statistical models commonly used in the field of psychometrics. This course will cover Classical Test Theory, Generalizability Theory, Item Response Theory, and modern statisical and computational approaches to psychometrics.

To be able to:
* Have a deep understanding of psychometric theories and methods
* Have an understanding of different statistcal models used by psychometricians / quantitative psychologists
* Have a deep understanding of scale development
* Feel comfortable using R to estimate a variety of statistical models
