* Introduction to the network approach to psychometrics
* Introduction to network analysis
* Introduction to network (graphical) models

## Modern Psychometric Methods

* Latent Variable Models (IRT, CFA, EFA, etc.)
  - Reflective models
  - Formative models

## Challenges with Latent Variable Models

* Latent variable models do a poor job of specifying: 
  - The temporal precedence of the latent variable
  - The causal response processes
  - Causal associations among observed variables

## The Network Approach 

* Discontent with current methods led a group of reserachers to introduce and build on: 
  - Network theories of psychological phenomena 
  - Network (graphical) models

## Network Theories: Constructs as Dynamical Systems

* Reframe theories of psychological phenomena as a dynamic system of interactions among observable variables, which are referred to as **autonomous causal entities**.

* Most network psychometric theories pull from the literature on dynamic systems and complex systems. An example is considering depression not as a construct, but as an attractor state of the depression system. 

## Network (Graphical) Models

* Network psychometric analysis relies **heavily** on a class of statistical models called graphical models to estimate the network that underlies the observed variables. 

* One of the most common ways to estimate the underlying network is to use a model called the **Gaussian Graphical Model**, which is just a partial correlation matrix.

# Network Analysis 

## What is a Network? 

* Networks (graphs) are mathematical objects that represent connections among different entities. 

* Mathematically, networks consist of a: 
  - Set of nodes or vertices 
  - Set of edges or links

## Examples of Networks 

* Social Networks 
* Organizational Networks
* Biological Networks
* Information Networks

## What is a Psychometric Network?

* A psychometric network is a network in which the nodes are the observed variables and the edges are the conditional relationships among those observed variables.

## Network Types 

* We can broadly categorize networks by the directionality (or lack thereof) and weights of the edges:
  - Undirected vs Directed Networks
  - Unweighted vs Weighted Networks

* Psychometric network analysis typically deals with undirected and weighted networks.

## Matrix Representation of a Network

```{r}
w <- matrix(
  c(
    0, .50, .40, 0, 0, -.10,
    .50, 0, .30, -.30, 0, 0,
    .40, .30, 0, 0, 0, 0,
    0, -.30, 0, 0, .40, .30, 
    0, 0, 0, .40, 0, .20, 
    -.10, 0, 0, .30, .20, 0
  ),
  nrow = 6, ncol = 6, byrow = TRUE
)

a <- matrix(as.numeric(w != 0), nrow = 6, ncol = 6, byrow = T)
```

* The easiest way to mathematically manipulate a network is to turn it into a matrix. This matrix is referred to as an **adjacency matrix**. 

* Non-zero elements in the matrix represent connections between two nodes in the network. 

## Unweighted, Undirected Network

```{r}
qgraph::qgraph(a, color = c(bg = "#FEFBF6"), bg = "#FEFBF6")
```


## Adjacency Matrix

```{r}
a
```

## Weighted, Unirected Network 

```{r}
qgraph::qgraph(w, edge.labels = T, color = c(bg = "#FEFBF6"), bg = "#FEFBF6")
```

## Weight Matrix 

```{r}
w
```

## Analyzing Networks

* Local network properties: Metrics focused on specific parts of a network
* Global network properties: Metrics focused on the network as a whole

## Local Network Properties: Centrality 

* Centrality is a class of network metrics that measure the importance of a given node by counting and, at times, weighting the number of direct or indirect connections a node has with other nodes.

* Centrality metrics can be subdivided into: 
  - Direct connection centrality metrics
  - Indirect connection centrality metrics 

## Direct Connection Centrality Metrics

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Degree Centrality**: 

$$\sum_{j=1}^{n}{a_{ij}}$$

**Strength**: 

$$\sum_{j=1}^{n}{\lvert w_{ij}\rvert}$$

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Weighted Degree Centrality**: 

$$\sum_{j=1}^{n}{a_{ij}^{1-\alpha}\lvert w_{ij}\rvert^{\alpha}}$$

**Expected Influence**: 

$$\sum_{j=1}^{n}{a_{ij}w_{ij}}$$

:::

::::

## Direct Connection Centrality Example 

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| fig-align: center
rowSums(a) # Degree
rowSums(a*abs(w)) # Strength
rowSums(a*w) # Expected Influence
```

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
qgraph::qgraph(w, edge.labels = T, color = c(bg = "#FEFBF6"), bg = "#FEFBF6")
```

## Direct Connection Centrality `qgraph` Example 

```{r}
#| echo: true
qgraph::centralityPlot(w, include = c("Strength", "ExpectedInfluence"))
```

## Path Metrics

* Before we can calculate the indirect connection centrality metrics, we first need to understand path metrics:

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

**Length**: The distance between two nodes.

$$\text{Length}(i, j)=\frac{1}{\rvert w_{ij} \lvert^{\alpha}}$$

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

**Distance**: The shortest path between two nodes.

$$\text{Distance}(i, j)=min(w_{ik}+ \dots + w_{lj})$$

:::

::::

## Indirect Connection Centrality Metrics 

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

**Closeness**: 

$$\frac{1}{\sum_{j=1}^{n}\text{Distance}(i,j)}$$

**Betweeness**:

$$\sum_{<j,k>}\frac{\text{# shortest paths from j to k that go through i}}{\text{# shortest paths between j and k}}$$

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}


**Expected Influence Two**: 

$$\sum_{j=1}^{n}a_{ij}w_{ij}+\sum_{j=1}^{n}a_{ij}w_{ij}\sum_{k=1}^{n}a_{jk}w_{jk}$$

:::

::::

## Indirect Connection Centrality Example 

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| fig-align: center
(rowSums(w) + a%*%rowSums(w)) |> t()  # Expected Influence 2
qgraph::centralityPlot(w, include = c("all"))
```

## Local Network Properties: Clustering

* Clustering is a metric that looks at how often two nodes that are connected to the same focal node are also connected to one another: the friend of my friend is also my friend.

* I haven't seen this used a whole lot in psychometric network analysis. 

## Global Network Properties: Density

* It is often of interest to undestand how connected your network is. This can be calculated using a network metric called **density**.

$$\text{Density}=\frac{\text{# Observed Edges}}{\text{# Possible Edges}}=\frac{\sum_{<i, j>}a_{ij}}{n(n-1)}$$

## Global Network Properties: Small Worlds

* Six degrees of Kevin Bacon
* Small world network models are characterized by high clustering and short average path lengths--this does not happen when networks form completely at random.  

## Calculating Density and Small World Index in R

```{r}
#| echo: true
toy_graph <- qgraph::qgraph(w, DoNotPlot = TRUE) # Create your graph
toy_graph |> igraph::as.igraph() |> igraph::edge_density() # Calculate density
qgraph::smallworldIndex(toy_graph)$index # Calculate small world index
```

## Global Network Properties: Community Detection

* In network analysis, community detection is a set of alogrithms that attempt to find hidden communities within a network by identifying sets of nodes that have more connections among themselves than they have with other nodes outside of the set. 

* Common algorithms: 
  - Walktrap Algorithm
  - Louvain Algorithm
  - Fast-Greedy Algorithm

## Community Detection Example

```{r}
#| echo: true
# Need to take the absolute value of the weighted network
toy_graph <- qgraph(abs(w), DoNotPlot = TRUE)
toy_graph |> igraph::as.igraph() |> igraph::walktrap.community()
```

## Network Psychometrics

-   In Part 1, you learned the theory and rationale and math of psychometric networks

-   In Part 2, we learn how to **DO** estimation of psychometric networks

## Reminder from Part 1

-   Networks serve as an abstraction to represent the relationships (edges) between entities (nodes)

-   KEY!!!

## Reminder from Part 1

-   Networks serve as an abstraction to represent the relationships (edges) between entities (nodes)

-   DISTINGUISHING!!!

## Reminder from Part 1

-   Networks serve as an abstraction to represent the relationships (edges) between entities (nodes)

-   FACTOR!!!

## Reminder from Part 1

-   In social networks, your data both nodes and edges that are observed

    -   Obvi there are more complex situations where you have missing data

        -   Network missingness can be very tricky (Morrissett, 2013; Kossinets, 2006)

    -   This is neither time nor place for that though...

## Reminder from Part 1

## Reminder from Part 1

-   I/O context:

    -   Teams / Co-workers

-   Clinical:

    -   We can form a network between therapist and patients in group therapy setting (Koelhy & Shivy, 1998)

-   Developmental

    -   We can form a network of how babbies interact with other babbies (Cochran & Brassard, 1979)

## Psychometric Networks

-   When do psychometric network analysis / using psychometric network models:

    -   All your nodes (items) are observed

    -   You are e s t i m a t i n g the relationships (edges) between nodes (items)

## There are many paths to Rome

1.  Start with a substantive question utilizing network theory (e.g. "I want to understand Construct X as a dynamic construct and/or complex system."
    i)  Sachisthal et al. (2019)
        A.  Scientific Interests Network - Psychometric network on student's interest in science

## There are many paths to Rome

![](images/paste-1FAA56D3.png){fig-align="center"}

## There are many paths to Rome

1.  Theoretical perspectives on interests are all over the place.
2.  Interests can potentially be conceptualized as "interacting indicators of interest components...indicators of affective, behavioral, and cognitive (including value and knowledge) components"
3.  These indicators make up the variable of interest rather than being indicators of it
4.  Provides new targets for interventions

## There are many paths to Rome

2.  Collect data
    i)  Research designs for network psychometrics can be:
        A.  Longitudinal (e.g. EMA design; see Emorie Beck \@ UC Davis for lots of examples of this)
        B.  Cross-sectional
    ii)  Sampling should be no different than any other psychological study

## There are many paths to Rome

3.  Analyze data

## Analyzing Psychometric Network Data

We can do this with raw data OR correlation matrix

```{r, echo=T}

# First, we will load (or install first if you don't have it!) the qgraph AND the psych package:

library(qgraph)
library(psych)
library(dplyr) # Also loading this because I don't align with Alex's use of |> pipe
```

## Analyzing Psychometric Network Data

```{r, echo=T}
# Next, let's examine our dataset

data("bfi")

glimpse(head(bfi))
```

## Analyzing Psychometric Network Data

```{r}

# Lets start with just viewing the correlation matrix

select(bfi, matches("[A-Z][0-9]")) %>% 
    psych::corPlot()
```

## Analyzing Psychometric Network Data

```{r}
# We can start by visualizing this as a network:

qgraph(cor(select(bfi, matches("[A-Z][0-9]")), use = 'complete.obs'), color = c(bg = "#FEFBF6"), bg = "#FEFBF6")
```

## Analyzing Psychometric Network Data

The previous network was an unregularized

-   This means **all** edges were estimated, even super tiny ones

-   But, what happens if we \~ regularize \~ it?

## Analyzing Psychometric Network Data

Quick aside:

What is regularization?

A process of "shrinking" tiny values towards zero.

![](images/paste-34DB6608.png)

## Analyzing Psychometric Network Data

-   What we can see is that the correlation matrix is much more "sparse"

-   There are substantially more 0's all over the place and the previously bigger values are smaller than before.

```{r, fig.align='center'}
corPlot(round(EBICglasso(S = cor(select(bfi, matches("[A-Z][0-9]")), use = 'complete.obs'), n = nrow(select(bfi, matches("[A-Z][0-9]")))), 2))
```

## Analyzing Psychometric Network Data

What does this regularized network look like?

```{r, fig.align='center'}
qgraph(round(EBICglasso(S = cor(select(bfi, matches("[A-Z][0-9]")), use = 'complete.obs'), n = nrow(select(bfi, matches("[A-Z][0-9]")))), 2), color = c(bg = "#FEFBF6"), bg = "#FEFBF6")
```

## Analyzing Psychometric Network Data

Why do we regularize?

-   Separating signal from noise

-   We know everything is (to a degree) correlated with everything

-   Regularization helps siphon the signal from the noise and what's left over is "truth" and aid with selecting the "true" model.

## Analyzing Psychometric Network Data

Now that we've estimated a psychometric network... what can we do?

1\) Estimate **global** network properties

2\) Estimate **individual node** properties

## Analyzing Psychometric Network Data {.smaller .scrollable}

1\) Estimate **global** network properties

Example: *Smallworldness*

Substantive value: Lots of networks have smallworld properties (see Jonathan Kleinberg or Aaron Clauset's work on this for example of small-world networks all over the place). A smallworld network implies any two nodes in the network can reach each other through a short sequence of other nodes (Kleinberg, 2001)

Daleage et al. (2016) demonstrate that attitudinal networks display smallworld characteristics

Carter et al. (2020) demonstrate the utility of smallworld networks for predicting turnover

```{r}
qgraph(round(EBICglasso(S = cor(select(bfi, matches("[A-Z][0-9]")), use = 'complete.obs'), n = nrow(select(bfi, matches("[A-Z][0-9]")))), 2), DoNotPlot = T) %>% 
  smallworldness() %>% 
  data.frame()
```

## Analyzing Psychometric Network Data

2\) Estimate **individual node** properties

```{r}
qgraph(round(EBICglasso(S = cor(select(bfi, matches("[A-Z][0-9]")), 
                                use = 'complete.obs'), 
                        n = nrow(select(bfi, matches("[A-Z][0-9]")))), 2), 
       DoNotPlot = T) %>% 
  qgraph::centrality() %>% 
  data.frame() %>% 
  select(Betweenness, Closeness) %>% 
  arrange(-Betweenness) %>% 
  head()
```

## Analyzing Psychometric Network Data

Additional things you can do with networks:

-   Community Detection

    -   Do different nodes "hang out" together?

## Analyzing Psychometric Network Data

-   Network Comparison Test (NCT)

    -   Do different groups have the same / different network structures?

    -   BIG open area for research imo

        -   Lots of existing work on graph comparisons in CS / Stats

        -   How does it translate to psychometric data?

            -   Cosma Shalizi is prolific in this space

## Some Critiques of Psychometric Network Analysis

* **Model Selection**: Are network models appropriate for psychological data?
* **Study Design**: Can we infer anything about a dynamical system from cross-sectional data? 
* **Estimation Reliability**: How stable/replicable are psychometric networks?  
* **Interpretation of Measures**: Can we even interpet network metrics applied to psychometric networks?
