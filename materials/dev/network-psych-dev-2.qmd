## Network Psychometrics

-   In Part 1, you learned the theory and rationale and math of psychometric networks

-   In Part 2, we learn how to **DO** estimation of psychometric networks

## Reminder from Part 1

-   Networks serve as an abstraction to represent the relationships (edges) between entities (nodes)

-   KEY!!!

## Reminder from Part 1

-   DISTINGUISHING!!!

## Reminder from Part 1

-   Networks serve as an abstraction to represent the relationships (edges) between entities (nodes)

-   FACTOR!!!

## Reminder from Part 1

-   In social networks, your data both nodes and edges that are observed

    -   Obvi there are more complex situations where you have missing data

        -   Network missingness can be very tricky (Morrissett, 2013; Kossinets, 2006)

    -   This is neither time nor place for that though...

## Reminder from Part 1

-   I/O context:

    -   Teams / Co-workers

-   Clinical:

    -   We can form a network between therapist and patients in group therapy setting (Koelhy & Shivy, 1998)

-   Developmental

    -   We can form a network of how babbies interact with other babbies (Cochran & Brassard, 1979)

## Psychometric Networks

-   When do psychometric network analysis / using psychometric network models:

    -   All your nodes (items) are observed

    -   You are e s t i m a t i n g the relationships (edges) between nodes (items)

-   How do we do that?

## There are many paths to Rome

1.  Start with a substantive question utilizing network theory (e.g. "I want to understand Construct X as a dynamic construct and/or complex system."
    1.  Sachisthal et al. (2019)

        1.  Scientific Interests Network - Psychometric network on student's interest in science

## There are many paths to Rome

## There are many paths to Rome

1.  Theoretical perspectives on interests are all over the place.
2.  Interests can potentially be conceptualized as "interacting indicators of interest components...indicators of affective, behavioral, and cognitive (including value and knowledge) components"
3.  These indicator make up the variable of interest rather than being indicators of it
4.  Provides new targets for interventions

## There are many paths to Rome

2.  Collect data
    1.  Research designs for network psychometrics can be:

        1.  Longitudinal (e.g. EMA design; see Emorie Beck \@ UC Davis for lots of examples of this)

        2.  Cross-sectional

    2.  Sampling should be no different than any other psychological study

## There are many paths to Rome

3.  Analyze data

## Analyzing Psychometric Network Data

We can do this with raw data OR correlation matrix

```{r, echo=T}

# First, we will load (or install first if you don't have it!) the qgraph AND the psych package:

library(qgraph)
library(psych)
library(dplyr) # Also loading this because I don't align with Alex's use of |> pipe
```

## Analyzing Psychometric Network Data

```{r, echo=T}
# Next, let's examine our dataset

data("bfi")

glimpse(head(bfi))
```

## Analyzing Psychometric Network Data

```{r}

# Lets start with just viewing the correlation matrix

select(bfi, matches("[A-Z][0-9]")) %>% 
    psych::corPlot()
```

## Analyzing Psychometric Network Data

```{r}
# We can start by visualizing this as a network:

qgraph(cor(select(bfi, matches("[A-Z][0-9]")), use = 'complete.obs'))
```

## Analyzing Psychometric Network Data

The previous network was an unregularized

-   This means **all** edges were estimated, even super tiny ones

-   But, what happens if we \~ regularize \~ it?

## Analyzing Psychometric Network Data

Quick aside:

What is regularization?

A process of "shrinking" tiny values towards zero.

![](images/paste-34DB6608.png)

## Analyzing Psychometric Network Data

-   What we can see is that the correlation matrix is much more "sparse"

-   There are substantially more 0's all over the place and the previously bigger values are smaller than before.

```{r, fig.align='center'}
corPlot(round(EBICglasso(S = cor(select(bfi, matches("[A-Z][0-9]")), use = 'complete.obs'), n = nrow(select(bfi, matches("[A-Z][0-9]")))), 2))
```

## Analyzing Psychometric Network Data

What does this regularized network look like?

```{r, fig.align='center'}
qgraph(round(EBICglasso(S = cor(select(bfi, matches("[A-Z][0-9]")), use = 'complete.obs'), n = nrow(select(bfi, matches("[A-Z][0-9]")))), 2))
```

## Analyzing Psychometric Network Data

Why do we regularize?

-   Separating signal from noise

-   We know everything is (to a degree) correlated with everything

-   Regularization helps siphon the signal from the noise and what's left over is "truth" and aid with selecting the "true" model.

## Analyzing Psychometric Network Data

Now that we've estimated a psychometric network... what can we do?

1\) Estimate **global** network properties

2\) Estimate **individual node** properties

## Analyzing Psychometric Network Data

1\) Estimate **global** network properties

Example: *Smallworldness*

Smallworldness - A ratio of the number of triangles in a network (transitivity) to the the average number of steps along the shortest paths for all possible pairs of network nodes.

Substantive value: Lots of networks have smallworld properties (see Jonathan Kleinberg or Aaron Clauset's work on this for example of small-world networks all over the place). A smallworld network implies any two nodes in the network can reach each other through a short sequence of other nodes (Kleinberg, 2001)

Daleage et al. (2016) demonstrate that attitudinal networks display smallworld characteristics

Carter et al. (2020) demonstrate the utility of smallworld networks for predicting turnover

```{r}
qgraph(round(EBICglasso(S = cor(select(bfi, matches("[A-Z][0-9]")), use = 'complete.obs'), n = nrow(select(bfi, matches("[A-Z][0-9]")))), 2), DoNotPlot = T) %>% 
  smallworldness() %>% 
  data.frame()
```

## Analyzing Psychometric Network Data

2\) Estimate **individual node** properties

```{r}
qgraph(round(EBICglasso(S = cor(select(bfi, matches("[A-Z][0-9]")), 
                                use = 'complete.obs'), 
                        n = nrow(select(bfi, matches("[A-Z][0-9]")))), 2), 
       DoNotPlot = T) %>% 
  qgraph::centrality() %>% 
  data.frame() %>% 
  select(Betweenness, Closeness) %>% 
  arrange(-Betweenness) %>% 
  head()
```

## Analyzing Psychometric Network Data

Additional things you can do with networks:

-   Community Detection

    -   Do different nodes "hang out" together?

-   Network Comparison Test (NCT)

    -   Do different groups have the same / different network structures?

    -   BIG open area for research imo

        -   Lots of existing work on graph comparisons in CS / Stats

        -   How does it translate to psychometric data?

            -   Cosma Shalizi is prolific in this space
