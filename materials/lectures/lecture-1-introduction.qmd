## What is Psychometics?

> Psychometrics, or quantitative psychology, is the disciplinary home of a set of statistical models and methods that have been developed primarily to summarize, describe, and draw inferences from empirical data collected in psychological research.

# The Theoretical Side of Psychometrics: Test Theories & Latent Variable Models

## Theory & Methods in Psychometrics

-   Test Theory: A mixture of theoretical and statistical models that have been developed to advance educational and psychological measurement.

-   Latent Variable Models: A family of statistical models that explain statistical dependencies among sets of observed random variables (e.g. survey responses) by appealing to variation in a smaller set of unobserved (latent) variables.

## Test Theories in Psychometrics

-   There are three major test theories in Psychometrics:
    -   Classical Test Theory (CTT)
    -   Generalizability Theory (G-Theory)
    -   Item Response Theory (IRT)
-   The above theories have introduced and further refined the theories of test validity and test reliability.

## Classical Test Theory

-   CTT set the foundations for future test theories with the idea that an individual's observed test score is composed of two different additive components: True Score and Error.

$$\text{Observed Score} = \text{True Score} + \text{Error}$$

-   Through its introduction of True Score and Error, CTT helped to formalize the theories of test validity and reliability, respectively.

## Generalizability Theory

-   Build on CTT by further specifying the different sources of error that comprise an individual's observed score.

$$\text{Observed Scored} = \mu + E_{rater} + E_{item} + E_{rater\times{}item}$$ \* G-Theory really furthered the development of reliability theory by introducing different types of reliability indices and drawing a distinction between relative and absolute test score comparisons.

## Item Response Theory

-   IRT is a modern measurement theory that focuses on the measurement characteristics of the individual items that make up an assessment.

-   Unlike CTT and G-Theory, IRT estimates measurement characteristics of the individual items independently from the abilities of the test takers---this is a big plus!

$$p(x_{ij} = 1 |\theta_{i},b_{j},a_{j})=\frac{1}{1 + e^{-a_{j}(\theta_{i}-b_{j})}}$$

## The Many Uses of Surveys and Assessments

-   Surveys / Assessments are used to assess a wide variety of constructs:
    -   Knowledge (SAT, GRE)
    -   Mental health disorders (Beck's Depression Inventory)
    -   Personality (Hogan PEI, Big 5 scales)
    -   Attitudes
    -   Skills

# A Primer on Probability Theory and Statistical Inference

## Who cares?

-   Why do we care about probability theory and statistical inference? What have they ever done for us?

## Statistical Inference

![](lecture-1-img/statistical-inference.png){fig-align="center"}

## Model-Based Statistical Inference

-   Model-based inference allows us to make inferences to an <strong>infinite population</strong> from non-random samples as long as we are willing to make three (strong) assumptions:
    -   Assume a generative statistical model
    -   Assume parametric distributional assumptions on our model
    -   Assume a selection mechanism

## Model-Based Statistical Inference

$$\underbrace{y_{i}=\beta_{0} + \beta_{1}x_{i} + \epsilon_{i}}_{\text{Generative Model}}$$

$$\underbrace{\epsilon_{i}\stackrel{iid}{\sim}N(0, \sigma^{2})}_{\text{Parametric Assumptions & Selection Mech.}}$$

## Role of Probability Theory in Statistics

$$\underbrace{f_{Y|X}(y_{i}|x_{i})}_{\text{Conditional}\\ \;\;\;\;\text{PDF}}\overbrace{\stackrel{iid}{\sim}}^{\;\;\text{Dist.}\\\text{Assump.}}\underbrace{N(\beta_{0} + \beta_{1}x_{i}, \sigma^{2})}_{\text{Normal PDF}}\;\;\;\;\to$$ $$y_{i}=\beta_{0} + \beta_{1}x_{i} + \epsilon_{i}$$

## What is Probability Theory?

-   <strong>Probability theory</strong> is a mathematical construct used to represent processes involving randomness, unpredictability, or intrinsic uncertainty.

-   <strong>Probability theory is a model!</strong> It allows for us to deal with the uncertainty that comes from being unable to measure every little thing that may be related to our outcome.

## Random Generative Process (RGP)
